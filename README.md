# MotoRumble: Your Ultimate Moto Vehicle Destination

## Project Purpose

MotoRumble is a multi-page, responsive website designed to showcase a collection of moto vehicles, provide information about the company, and facilitate user inquiries. It serves as a digital showroom, integrating modern web development practices including HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS for responsive design and styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements.

## Website Structure

The website consists of the following key pages:

*   **Home (`index.html`):** The landing page featuring a hero section, highlights of featured vehicles, and a brief introduction to MotoRumble.
*   **Inventory (`inventory.html`):** A comprehensive gallery displaying all available moto vehicles with images and descriptions.
*   **About Us (`about.html`):** Details about the company's mission, history, and team members.
*   **Contact (`contact.html`):** A page equipped with a contact form for user inquiries, along with company contact information and a map placeholder.

## Code Organization

The project codebase is organized into logical folders to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability:

*   `/css`: Contains all Cascading Style Sheets, primarily `style.css`, which handles the overall layout, styling, and responsive design.
*   `/js`: Houses JavaScript files, including `script.js` for interactive functionalities like form validation.
*   `/images`: Stores all image assets used across the website, such as vehicle photos and team member portraits.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.
*   **Consistent Layout:** A shared header and footer across all pages ensure a unified user experience.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Includes client-side form validation on the Contact page to enhance user interaction.
*   **Semantic HTML5:** Utilizes modern HTML5 elements for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.

## How to Use

Navigating the MotoRumble website is straightforward. Here's a quick guide to its components and how to interact with them:

*   **Navigation Bar:** Located at the top of every page, the navigation bar allows you to effortlessly switch between the main sections of the website: `Home`, `Inventory`, `About Us`, and `Contact`.
*   **Home Page:** The starting point of your journey. Here you'll find a captivating hero section and a showcase of `Featured Vehicles`. Click on any featured vehicle's `View Details` button to learn more, or use the `View Inventory` button to see all available bikes.
*   **Inventory Page:** This page presents a comprehensive list of all moto vehicles. Each vehicle is displayed with an image, name, and a `View Details` button. Clicking this button will take you to a dedicated page with detailed specifications for that specific motorcycle.
*   **About Us Page:** Learn about MotoRumble's passion for motorcycles, our mission, and the dedicated team behind our operations.
*   **Contact Page:** If you have any inquiries about our vehicles or services, use the `Contact Form` on this page to send us a message. Our form includes client-side validation to ensure your details are correctly entered. You'll also find our contact information and a map showing our location in Nairobi City, Kenya.

## Performance Optimization

To ensure a fast and responsive user experience, especially when dealing with images, consider the following optimization steps:

1.  **Optimize Images (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Compress:** Use tools like TinyPNG or Compressor.io to reduce the file size of all images in the `/images` directory (e.g., `hero-bg.jpg`, `bike*.jpg`, `team*.jpg`) without significantly compromising quality.
    *   **Resize:** Ensure images are scaled to appropriate dimensions for their display on the website. For example, a hero image can be wider, but detail images or thumbnails should be sized reasonably.
    *   **Format:** Consider converting images to modern formats like WebP for better compression and faster loading times.

2.  **Minimize Assets:** For larger projects, consider minifying your CSS (`/css/style.css`) and JavaScript (`/js/script.js`) files to reduce their file sizes.
